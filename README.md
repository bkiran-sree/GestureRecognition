# GestureRecognition
An interactive gesture recognition platform using machine learning and computer vision for learning sign language and improving gesture-based communication.
Using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Python, the system tracks webcam input, processes gestures, and provides immediate feedback. Features include gesture tutorials, quizzes, and progress tracking, aimed at making gesture-based communication, such as sign language, more accessible and engaging.

Features
*Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Recognizes user gestures using webcam input.
*Instant Feedback: Provides immediate feedback to help users improve gesture accuracy.
*Interactive Tutorials: Step-by-step lessons to help users learn gestures.
*Quizzes & Progress Tracking: Tracks user progress and provides quizzes for skill assessment.
*Customizable Settings: Personalize feedback and difficulty settings to suit learning preferences.
Technologies Used
*Python: Main programming language.
*OpenCV: For computer vision tasks like gesture detection and image processing.
*TensorFlow: For machine learning model training and gesture recognition.
*NumPy: Used for handling data and image arrays.


Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gesture-recognition-project.git
cd gesture-recognition-project
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy
python main.py
Usage
Launch the application using the command python main.py.
Follow the on-screen instructions to start practicing gestures.
Use the interactive tutorials to learn new gestures and track your progress through quizzes.
The system will provide immediate feedback based on the accuracy of your gestures.
