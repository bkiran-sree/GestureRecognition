# Gesture Recognition
An interactive gesture recognition platform using machine learning and computer vision for learning sign language and improving gesture-based communication.
Using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Python, the system tracks webcam input, processes gestures, and provides immediate feedback. Features include gesture tutorials, quizzes, and progress tracking, aimed at making gesture-based communication, such as sign language, more accessible and engaging.

## Features
* Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Recognizes user gestures using webcam input.
* Instant Feedback: Provides immediate feedback to help users improve gesture accuracy.
* Interactive Tutorials: Step-by-step lessons to help users learn gestures.
* Quizzes & Progress Tracking: Tracks user progress and provides quizzes for skill assessment.
* Customizable Settings: Personalize feedback and difficulty settings to suit learning preferences.

## Technologies Used
* Python: Main programming language.
* OpenCV: For computer vision tasks like gesture detection and image processing.
* TensorFlow: For machine learning model training and gesture recognition.
* NumPy: Used for handling data and image arrays.

## Installation
# 1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/bkiran-sree/gestureRecognition.git
cd gestureRecognition
```
# 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
Creating a virtual environment helps manage project dependencies. To set it up, run the following command:
- **For Windows:**
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **For MacOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
  
# 3. Install dependencies
You can install the dependencies manually. Here's a list of common dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

# 4. Run the application
To start the application, run:
```bash
python main.py
```

Your webcam will activate, and you can start practicing gestures!

---

## Usage
- Launch the application using the command python main.py.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to start practicing gestures.
- Use the interactive tutorials to learn new gestures and track your progress through quizzes.
- The system will provide immediate feedback based on the accuracy of your gestures.
